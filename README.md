## Our process
### Pseudo code
- Home page with title and animal crossing background
-Form to fill out users information (hemisphere, month, time of day)
- Listen for button click to store users inputted information
- Upon form submission
  - store user inputs into variables
  - Make an AJAX request to the API based on user inputs to search matching critters
- Return critters based on criteria 
  - Display images, type, stats, location etc
  - Display based on availability (ie gray out what is not available to be caught/discovered) 
- Option to clear form and search again

### MVP
1. Landing page to welcome the user to the site
2. Prompt user for information (ie time of year/day/where they live/etc)
3. Return information to user regarding critters available to find based on inputs
